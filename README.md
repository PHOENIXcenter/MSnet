## 1. Use quantms to re-analyze the data in PRIDE (Yasset) and iProX (Cheng and Zhiqiang)

1.1 For input data
- MS instrument: High-resolution data only
- HCD/CID/ETD
- Do not consider species. But Human at first. And then mouse, yeast ... (including other species)
- DDA at first. Then DIA.
- TMT and Label-free

1.2 For analysis tools
- Search engine: MSGF+, Comet, SAGE
- Integration algorithm: ?
- QC for multiple datasets?
- Hardware requirement: XXX

## 2. The output file format
- new format

## 3. Implement PANDAnovo (LLM) into quantms

## 4. Website for data sharing and data visualization:
- USI?
- Spectrum anatation?

## 5. Schedule and Division
to do done.
